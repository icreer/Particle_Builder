# Particle_Builder

# Overview

The particle builder is a game that is a mash-up of asteroid in 2048. 
The overall goal is to build largest stable atom that you can. Witch is a 
debated topic but in nature is Uranium with a atomic number of 92. The 
challenge of the game is building up to Uranium from a single up quark. As 
you build up to a Uranium Atom you can build an unstable radioactive atom 
that once can lead to your atom decaying and you being set back in your 
progress of building your atom. Another risk that the player has is that high 
energy light waves can come in and destroy your atom by chipping off a 
electron.
