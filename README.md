# Particle_Builder

# Overview

The particle builder is a game that is a mash-up of asteroid and 2048. 
The overall goal is to build largest stable atom that you can. In nature,
the largest stable atom is Uranium, with a atomic weight of 92. The 
challenge of the game is building up to Uranium from a single up quark. As 
you build up to a Uranium Atom you can build an unstable radioactive isotope 
that can lead to your atom decaying and you being set back in your 
progress of building your atom. High energy light also spawns, and if it hits
the player then the player loses an electron.
